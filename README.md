# This is Exploratory Data analysis project on IPL data
🏏 IPL Data Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset.
The goal of this analysis is to understand player performance, team statistics, match outcomes, and various patterns hidden inside the data.

📌 Project Overview

In this notebook, I analyze the IPL dataset using Python and major data science libraries.
The project explores:

Team-wise and player-wise performance

Toss decisions and their impact

Winning patterns across seasons

Most successful teams and players

Runs, wickets, boundaries distribution

Match outcomes & venue analysis

Any other interesting insights discovered through visuals

The primary aim is to derive meaningful insights that help understand the IPL more deeply.

🛠️ Tech Stack Used

Python

Pandas – Data cleaning & manipulation

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Interactive analysis

📂 Dataset Details

The IPL dataset includes:

Match information

Teams and venue details

Toss decisions

Winners and margins

Season-wise summaries

(If you used a Kaggle dataset, you can mention the source here.)

📊 Key Insights Discovered

✔ Top-performing teams over the years
✔ Most successful captains & players
✔ Impact of toss decisions on match results
✔ Venues that favor batting or bowling
✔ Run distribution patterns
✔ Player statistics like boundaries, wickets, and strike rates

📈 Visualizations

The notebook contains multiple graphs such as:

Bar charts

Pie charts

Count plots

Line graphs

Heatmaps

These visuals help make the analysis easier to understand.
